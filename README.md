# Lapis, Papyrus, Scalpellus

Imagine that you're an archaeologist and you've just uncovered evidence of a game that the ancient Romans played, called "Lapis, Papyrus, Scalpellus." You want to recreate it online to show the world your discovery. 

Surprisingly enough, the game is exactly the same as the one we modern-day humans know as "Rock, Paper, Scissors." Some things never change.
